# Copies an already-built, natively compiled plugin library into goreleaser's
# build output path.

# Open-source goreleaser has no way to import a prebuilt binary directly (that
# is a GoReleaser Pro feature); it always compiles a real Go package per
# target. .goreleaser.yml builds a tiny placeholder package instead and runs
# this script as a post-build hook to substitute the real cgo c-shared
# library produced separately by `make build` on each native CI runner.
